Need is to be able to set alarms.
From the tablet, which have no GPS, so can't use the regular application.

Use termux:boot to launch a python flask + bootstrapjs web app
Let use the navigator to reach the page at http://localhost:1337/

The page should be simple, possibly with tabs?

One page get settings, and display them all, letting the user
modify anything, and click on a "Save" button.
